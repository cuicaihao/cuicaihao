As a **Senior Data Scientist** (Data Analytics) and former **Control System Engineer** (Planning and Decesion Making), today I'm working mostly on Computer Vision, NLP and Deep Learning applications for data analysis with Python, Java, JS and C/C++! I'm also an avid contributor to open source communities and love to create and develop new projects and ideas around NLP and Graph Algorithms!

- üìù Visit [C.Cui Blog](https://cuicaihao.com/) to find interesting articles.
- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on Data Platform and Recommendation System for the largest retail business in Australia.
- üå± I have been practicing Software Product Management (SPM) for a few private projects related the stock markert and funds analysis since 2019.
- üòé Keep building on my project on quantitative trading and stock ranking software.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I originally planned to be an artist/painter, but accidentally got on the ship of science and technology~
- ü§î 2023 Goals:
  - [ ] Keep being role model and the top 10% in Team, this is challenging task when surrounded by smart and hardworking people.
  - [ ] Keep supporting academic communities by giving reviews and feedbacks as reviewer and associate editor.
  - [ ] Publish one paper on first~second tier academic journals in 2023 on AI application in industry.
  - [ ] Contribute more to the Deep Learning Open Source projects ([TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch) and [PaddleX](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle)).
  - Write 6 blogs of technology or algorithm applications on my website.
    - [X] [How To Write Bash Scripts on Unix/Linux/MacOS](https://cuicaihao.com/learn-how-to-write-bash-scripts-on-unix-linux/) 
    - [ ] TBC

üë®üèª‚Äçüíª **Open Source Package**
- [SplitRaster](https://pypi.org/project/splitraster/) is a python package to split a large image into small tiles. It is useful for deep learning and computer vision tasks. The package can also be used to split a large image into small tiles with geo-information embedded, like `tif`, `tiff`.
