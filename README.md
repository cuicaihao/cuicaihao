As a **Senior Data Scientist** and **Control System Engineer**, I'm working mostly with Computer Vision and Deep Learning application for data analysis along with Python, JS and C/C++! I'm also an avid contributor to open source and love to create and develop new projects and ideas around CV and NLP!
