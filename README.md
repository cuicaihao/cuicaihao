As a **Senior Data Scientist** and **Control System Engineer**, I'm working mostly with Computer Vision and Deep Learning application for data analysis with Python, JS and C/C++! I'm also an avid contributor to open source and love to create and develop new projects and ideas around CV and NLP!

- 📝 Visit [C.Cui Blog](https://cuicaihao.com/) to find interesting articles.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Remote Sensing Technologies.
- 🌱 I have been practicing Software Product Management (SPM) with engineering teams of Traffic, Water, Civil and Finance.
- 🤔 2021 Goals: contribute more to the Deep Learning Open Source projects ([TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch) and [PaddleX](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle)).
- 😎 I have been building on OpenSource project on Quantitative trading and stock ranking.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I originally planned to be an artist, but accidentally got on the ship of science~
