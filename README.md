As a **Senior Data Scientist** and **Control System Engineer**, I'm working mostly on Computer Vision and Deep Learning applications for data analysis with Python, JS and C/C++! I'm also an avid contributor to open source communities and love to create and develop new projects and ideas around CV and NLP! Besides, I believe I am still quite good with electronic and control engineering.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on Remote Sensing Technologies and Billing System Analytics.
- üå± I have been practicing Software Product Management (SPM) with engineering teams of Traffic, Water, Civil and Finance.
- ü§î 2022 Goals:
  - Keep being role model and the top 10%.
  - Contribute more to the Deep Learning Open Source projects ([TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow), [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch) and [PaddleX](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle)).
  - Write 10 Blogs on technology development, research paper review.
  - Publish two papers on first~second tier academic journals.
- üòé Keep building on my OpenSource project on Quantitative trading and stock ranking software.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I originally planned to be an artist/painter, but accidentally got on the ship of science and technology~
